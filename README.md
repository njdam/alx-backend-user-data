- **SQL**: Query language for interacting with databases.

### Frameworks and Libraries:
- **Flask**: Micro web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database interactions.
- **Marshmallow**: Library for object serialization and deserialization.

### Database Management Systems:
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source relational database management system.

### Tools:
- **Git**: Version control system for collaboration and code management.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for deploying applications.
